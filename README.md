# HamClockV2.0: FT8, General, Settings, World Modes with Buttons - Hybrid BMP/Code
# Created collaboratively by Pete Parise and Grok (xAI), Feb 2025
# A hybrid display solution for the Matrix Portal M4 using CircuitPython 8.2.10.
# Features:
# - Compiled BMP sprites (tx_red.bmp, tx_blue.bmp) for TX boxes with gamma-adjusted colors,
#   solving bit-depth rendering issues from earlier versions.
# - Code-generated Bitmap/Palette graphics for line, drift, and dots, reverting to proven methods.
# - Four modes: FT8 (TX toggle), General, Settings, World (with added line/drift/dots, centered time).
# - Built through iterative troubleshooting, leveraging Pete's insights on LED gamma and mode design.
# First of hopefully many joint projects—capturing time, creativity, and pixel precision!
